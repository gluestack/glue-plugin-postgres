# Goals

##

<br/>

* Install **postgres instance** into our **Gluestack Project**.

<br/>

* Run our **postgres instance** inside our **Engine Container**.

<br/>

* **Postgres instance** will act as our database for the application.
  We can interact with it by installing other plugins like **Glue Plugin
  Graphql** which depends upon this plugin in order to interact with
  data.
