# How it works

##

<br/>

* ## Working
  
  <br/>
  
  * **Postgres Plugin Instance** image will be running inside a docker container which
  is managed by our **Engine** plugin.
  
  
  <br/>
  
  
  * Behind the scene what is happening is, when we have installed the postgres plugin and
  configured it, our **Glue Engine Plugin** adds **postgres** image inside its docker file
  and from there it runs the postgres image.
  
  
  <br/>
  
  
  * Our directory stucture for the **postgres plugin instance** will be something
    like this:
    <br/>

    ```
      ðŸ“¦databases
        â”— ðŸ“‚postgres
          â”— ðŸ“œREADME.md
    ```
  <br/>
  <br/>
  
  
  * In order to start running this plugin we need to run the following command:
    
    <br/>
  
    ```bash
      $ node glue develop:up
    ```
  
    <br/>

    This command will start running the docker image of all the instances
    and plugin we have created. Here, in this case it will start running
    our **postgres plugin instance**, inside our **Engine** container.

* ## Instructions to start development of auth plugin instance
  
  <br/>
  
  * In order to interact with **postgres plugin database**, we can install another
  plugin named **Glue Plugin Graphql** which injects **Hasura Engine** which is
  connected with our postgres database.
