# How it works

##

<br/>

* ## Working
  
  <br/>
  
  * **Postgres Plugin Instance** image will be running inside a docker container which
  is managed by your **Backend-Engine** plugin.
  
  
  <br/>
  
  
  * Behind the scene what is happening is, when you have installed the postgres plugin and
  configured it, your **Glue Backend-Engine Plugin** adds **postgres** image inside its docker file
  and from there it runs the postgres image.
  
  
  <br/>
  
  
  * Your directory stucture for the **postgres plugin instance** will be something
    like this:
    <br/>

    ```jsx
      ðŸ“¦databases
        â”— ðŸ“‚postgres
          â”— ðŸ“œREADME.md
    ```
  <br/>
  <br/>
  
  
  * In order to start running this plugin you need to run the following command:
    
    <br/>
  
    ```bash
    $ node glue develop:up
    ```
  
    <br/>

    This command will start running the docker container of all the instances
    and plugin you have created. Here, in this case it will start running
    your **postgres plugin instance** container, with the help of your **Backend-Engine
    plugin instance**.

  <br/>

* ## Instructions to start development with this plugin
  
  <br/>
  
  * In order to interact with **postgres plugin database**, you can install another
  plugin named **Glue Plugin Graphql** which injects **Hasura Engine** which is
  connected with your postgres database.
