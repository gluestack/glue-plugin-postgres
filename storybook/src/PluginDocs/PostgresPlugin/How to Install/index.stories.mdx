# How to Install

To add **postgres** into your gluestack project, you can run the following command in project's root directory:
```sh
$ node glue add postgres <instance-name>
```

For instance, let's install an instance named **postgres** in our gluestack project:
```sh
$ node glue add postgres postgres
```

After that, you will be prompted with following question - "_Do you want to use external postgres? (yes/no)_"<br/>
If you want to use your own custom postgres server, you can type yes or if you want to use postgres within gluestack - you can go with no.<br/>

And after that, you will be prompted for **database name, database username, database password**.

Here's how the console output looks like:

Your plugin instance will be installed within **backend/databases** directory.
