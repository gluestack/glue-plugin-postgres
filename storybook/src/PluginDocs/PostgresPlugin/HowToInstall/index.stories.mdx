# How to install



<br/>

* First go to your local terminal and type this command in order to install this plugin

  <br/>

    ```bash
    $ node glue add postgres <instance-name>
    ```

  <br/>

* For example, In my case I wanted to install **postgres plugin instance** with my instance
  name as **“postgres”**, then I will follow this pattern to install postgres plugin instance in
  my app:

  <br/>
  
    ```bash
    $ node glue add postgres postgres
    ```
    
    Here my instance name is **postgres**.

  <br/>

* Now, after installing the dependency it will ask you for **database name, database username,
  database password**. In my case I have provided it with default configuration.

  Option will be something like this:
    
    
    <img src='/assets/postgresScreenshot.png' />
    

  <br/>

* If the plugin is installed successfully then you can go and see that inside **backend** 
  folder there is folder named “**database**” and inside that **database** folder, there
  is a new folder which is named after your instance i.e. **postgres** is created. 
  
  Overall directory path for the **postgres plugin instance** will be something like this:
  
  **backend/databases/postgres**
